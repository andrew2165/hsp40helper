# hsp40helper - An R package for HSP40AP helper functions

[UNDER DEVELOPMENT]

The goal here is to write some functions to streamline the data analysis (since it is repetative). 
I make *absolutely no* guarentees that this will ever get finished or in a working state...

That being said, stay tuned.
